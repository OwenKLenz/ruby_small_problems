It will print:

Moe 
Larry 
CURLY 
SHEMP 
Harpo 
CHICO
Groucho 
Zeppo

This is because the after appending all the array values from array1 to array2,
each index in array2 references the same objects (the strings) referenced by 
array1. Now, when any values in array one are mutated (as with String#upcase!),
both arrays are effected.
